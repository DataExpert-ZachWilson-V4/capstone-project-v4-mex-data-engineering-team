# Capstone Proposal: Humor Boost in Spanish

## Introduction

While music genre plays an enormous role in building and displaying social identity, the emotional expression of a song and — even more importantly — its emotional impression on the listener is often underestimated in the domain of music preferences.
This project more that business related, it has a more personal impact. I am coming from being a data scientist that turn into a Data Engineer. With the past of the time, Data Engineering become my passion and i always want to combine both, mainly Machine Learning  + Data Engineering applied to a music recommendation system. 
There are several music recommendations systems out there, but with this particular project the aim is:

## Project Scope

1. The project addresses the challenge of enhancing the music listening experience by integrating emotional states into the recommendation process.
2. The project is a prototype with an initial focus by recommendations from music in spanish.
3. As extra feature., if the time and scope is possible, extra information for the recommended songs like lyrics, listing the top music charts, searching for songs.

This system will continuously run in background and calculate and predict the mood of the user for a stipulated time period and it will play a song according to the mood of the user.

## Datasets

1. I will be using some publicly available song data from audioscrobbler like [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/)
2. [Spotify Million Playlist Dataset Challengue](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge)
3. Streaming Source 1: [Spotify Recommendations Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-recommendations)
4. Streaming Source 2: [Shazam API](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/shazam/playground/apiendpoint_c15fbc17-5fcb-4e6f-a785-07434c31e176)
5. [Mood Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deadskull7/fer2013)

## Tech Stack
1. Open CV
2. Flink/PubSub
3. GCP
4. Spark ML
5. Frontend to display the results (it still in development)

## Diagram Idea (It will be adapt to the project)
